# Training / fine-tuning extra dependencies (not needed for core API runtime)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-train.txt
# Keep versions reasonably pinned for reproducibility while allowing security updates via upper constraints later.

# Rationale:
# - Use relaxed lower bounds so existing infra/requirements pins (e.g., transformers==4.43.2) satisfy them.
# - bitsandbytes only on Linux to avoid installation friction on unsupported platforms.
# - numpy listed to ensure consistent version when training outside core runtime env.
