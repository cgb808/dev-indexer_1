- `docs/devops/DEVOPS_TODO_HISTORY.md` – Historical DevOps backlog & completion log.
- `docs/testing/AGENT_TEST_EXECUTION.md` – Agent-oriented test execution instructions.
- `docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` – Deployment & Kong gateway guide.
- `docs/security/RLS_POLICY_REFERENCE.md` – Row-Level Security policy design.
- `docs/workspace/REMOTE_WORKSPACE_LAYOUT.md` – Recommended remote workspace layout.

## Documentation Directories
| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `docs/` | Core architecture, memory integration, system and task checklists. |
| `documentation/architecture/` | Deep architectural narratives (retrieval, fine-tuning integration). |
| `documentation/fine_tuning/` | Fine-tuning strategy & implementation specifics. |
| `documentation/research/` | Research notes & exploratory findings. |
| `documentation/tutorials/` | Example-driven guides and educational excellence examples. |
| `sql/` | Database schema, RLS policies, migrations. |
| `scripts/` | Operational utilities, indexing, memory snapshots, setup automation. |
| `frontend/` | React/Vite dashboard source. |
| `app/` | FastAPI service, RAG pipeline, audio, metrics, health, central control scaffolding. |
| `infrastructure/` | Deployment configs, infra orchestration, environment scripts. |

## Conventions
- New docs: add to appropriate directory and append a bullet/link here.
- Deprecated docs: move to `archive/` and note replacement.
- Root kept lean: only `README.md` remains (other docs now under `docs/`).
