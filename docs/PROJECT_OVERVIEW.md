# Project Overview (Pointer)

The authoritative project overview is maintained in the repository root `README.md` to optimize developer onboarding friction (GitHub surfaces it automatically).

If you are browsing docs only, open: `../README.md` (root) for full architecture, quickstart, audio stack, metrics, and UI guidance.
