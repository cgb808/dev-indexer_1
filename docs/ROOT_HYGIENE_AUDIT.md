## Root Hygiene Audit (Automated Pass 2025-08-31)

Purpose: Inventory and triage root-level files violating or at risk of violating the SOP directory policy in `COPILOT.md`.

### Allowed Root (Baseline Policy)
`README.md`, `COPILOT.md`, `Makefile`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `kong.yml`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `project-index*.json`, `requirements-*.txt`, `settings.json`, `pytest.ini`, `run_tests.sh`, `.env*`, `.gitignore`.

### Findings
| File | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `AGENT_TEST_EXECUTION.md` | Empty placeholder | Safe to delete or move to `docs/testing/` |
| `AI_TERMINAL_SOP.md` | Removed (duplicate of `COPILOT.md`) | Completed |
| `DEVOPS.md` | Removed (empty) | Completed |
| `DEVOPS_TODO_HISTORY.md` | Removed (empty) | Completed |
| `DOCS_INDEX.md` | Removed (empty) | Completed |
| `TODO.md` | Removed (empty) | Completed |
| `DevTODO.md` | Removed (empty) | Completed |
| `DEVOPSTODO.md` | Removed (empty) | Completed |
| `BACKUP_LARGE_FILES.md` | Non-empty doc (backup policy) | Relocate to `docs/devops/` |
| `REMOTE_WORKSPACE_LAYOUT.md` | Removed (empty) | N/A |
| `MCP_RAG_INTEGRATION.md` | Removed (empty) | N/A |
| `RLS_POLICY_REFERENCE.md` | Removed (empty) | N/A |
| `hybrid_schema.json` | Relocated to `infrastructure/schemas/` | Completed |

### Proposed Actions (Phase 1)
1. Relocate non-empty domain docs to appropriate subfolders.
2. Delete empty redundant placeholders after 7 days (soft grace window).
3. Add CI lint that fails if new markdown appears at root outside allowlist.

### Tracking
Create script `scripts/root_hygiene_check.py` to enforce policy (to be implemented).
