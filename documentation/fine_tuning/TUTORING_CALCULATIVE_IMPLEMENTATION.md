## ðŸ“ˆ Results Demonstration

**Query**: "A store has 24 apples. If they sell 3/4 of them in the morning and 1/3 of the remaining apples in the afternoon, how many apples are left?"

**Response**: Detailed step-by-step calculation showing:
1. Morning sales calculation: 24 Ã— (3/4) = 18 apples
2. Remaining after morning: 24 - 18 = 6 apples  
3. Afternoon sales: 6 Ã— (1/3) = 2 apples
4. Final remaining: 6 - 2 = 4 apples

## ðŸŽ‰ Final Status

**CALCULATIVE FINE-TUNING WITH TUTORING DATASETS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The methodology now uses authentic tutoring content instead of general educational material, resulting in models that can provide proper step-by-step instruction and utilize proven pedagogical techniques. This represents the evolution of our calculative fine-tuning approach from a technical methodology to an educationally sound tutoring system.

**Next Evolution**: Expansion to additional subjects (Science, English Literature, etc.) using subject-specific tutoring datasets and methodologies.
