{"instruction": "The tutor is explaining Math tutoring - explaining algebra steps when the student interrupts with a clarifying question.", "input": "First, you need to isolate the variable by subtracting 3 from both sides. Second, you combine the like terms on the right side which gives you 2x = 8. [USER_INTERRUPTION] Okay, I see that, but I really need to know why we subtract 3 first and not divide by 2?", "output": "That's an excellent question, thanks for stopping me. It's a key concept. We subtract first to follow the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS, in reverse. We handle addition and subtraction before multiplication and division to isolate the 'x' term.

Who was this archduke guy exactly? Why did his death matter so much?", "output": "Great question - let me back up and explain who he was first, because that context is essential. Franz Ferdinand was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, so his assassination wasn't just any murder - it was an attack on a future emperor.

I'm still not getting what 'increment' means in this context.", "output": "Of course! Let me clarify 'increment' right now since it's fundamental. In programming, increment means to increase a value by a specific amount - usually by 1. So 'i++' takes whatever value i currently has and adds 1 to it. If i was 0, it becomes 1.

[USER_INTERRUPTION] Wait, I need to stop you there. How do we know it's symbolic? Like, how can you tell when something is a symbol versus just... a light?", "output": "Excellent critical thinking question! You're right to question that. We know it's symbolic because Fitzgerald deliberately draws our attention to it repeatedly throughout the novel, and he connects it to Gatsby's emotions and dreams. When authors mention specific objects multiple times and tie them to characters' deeper feelings, that's usually a signal that it's symbolic.
