Like, how can you tell when something is a symbol versus just... a light?", "output": "Excellent critical thinking question! You're right to question that. We know it's symbolic because Fitzgerald deliberately draws our attention to it repeatedly throughout the novel, and he connects it to Gatsby's emotions and dreams.
