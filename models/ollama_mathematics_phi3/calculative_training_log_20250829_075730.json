He bought 8 bundles of 15 feeds each and 60 individual feeds. \n\nSo, the total feeds from the bundles is:\n8 bundles * 15 feeds/bundle = 120 feeds\n\nAdding the individual feeds:\n120 feeds + 60 feeds = 180 feeds\n\nNow, we know that each bull and each black cow eats 3 barrels of feed. Donghyeon has 52 bulls, so the total feeds consumed by the bulls is:\n52 bulls * 3 feeds/bull = 156 feeds\n\nSince the feeds are just the right amount, the remaining feeds must be for the black cows. We can find out how many feeds are left for the black cows by subtracting the feeds consumed by the bulls from the total feeds:\n180 feeds - 156 feeds = 24 feeds\n\nNow, we can find out how many black cows there are by dividing the remaining feeds by the amount of feed each black cow consumes:\n24 feeds / 3 feeds/cow = 8 black cows\n\nTherefore, there are 8 black cows on Donghyeon's ranch.",
