          "expected": "[SOCRATIC_TUTORING_RESPONSE] User: I'm attempting to calculate the area of a triangle with sides measuring 9, 20, and 15. The only angle I'm aware of is the one opposite the 20-length side, which is 110 degrees; it's the triangle's only obtuse angle.\n\nAssistant: Excellent! To calculate the area of a triangle, we can use the formula \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\). However, we don't have the height. An alternative is to use the formula \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\times \\sin(C) \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the triangle's sides, and \\( C \\) is the angle between them. \n\nCould you specify which sides of the triangle are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and which angle is \\( C \\)?\n\nUser: 9=b and 15 =a\n\nAssistant: Excellent! Now we can use the formula \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\times \\sin(C) \\) to calculate the triangle's area. \n\nWhat is the result when you substitute \\( a = 15 \\), \\( b = 9 \\), and \\( C = 110 \\) degrees into the formula?\n\nUser: 63.4",
